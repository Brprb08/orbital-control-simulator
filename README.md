# Orbit Mechanics Simulator

This project is an interactive orbital mechanics simulator where users can control, plan, and visualize orbital transfers in real time. Currently a **work in progress**, this tool aims to provide an educational and hands-on experience in spaceflight dynamics, orbit transfers, and precision maneuvering.

## Features (Planned & In-Progress)

- **Free-Roam Transfer Control**: Execute and control orbital transfer burns to navigate between orbits.
- **Interactive UI Display**: Real-time updates for key metrics such as velocity, altitude, and fuel consumption.
- **Orbit Path Tracing**: Visualize the effects of your transfer burns and trace orbital paths over time.
- **Error Impact Demonstration**: Show how small errors in maneuvers can have significant effects on long-term orbital paths.
- **Fuel Consumption Tracking**: Manage and visualize fuel usage for each maneuver.
- **Potential Future Feature - Attitude Control**: Gain control of the satellite\u2019s orientation to execute precise maneuvers.

## Project Status

This project is currently in its **early development phase**, and many core features are still under construction. The main focus is on getting core orbital mechanics and user controls operational. As features are added, updates will be posted here.

## Usage

1. **Launch the Simulator**: Run the Unity project to enter the simulation.
2. **Control the Orbit**: Use interactive UI buttons to initiate burns and control orbit transfers.
3. **View Metrics**: Observe velocity, altitude, and fuel consumption in real time.
4. **Analyze Your Path**: Watch the impact of small maneuvering errors on your long-term orbit.

## Future Goals

- Full implementation of orbit transfers with customizable burns.
- Refinement of UI to better visualize trajectory changes and fuel usage.
- Enhanced physics for realistic gravitational effects and orbital decay.
- Add attitude control for spacecraft orientation.
