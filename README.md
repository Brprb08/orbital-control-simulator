# Orbital Control Simulator

A real-time orbital mechanics simulator built in **Unity** with physics computations handled with **C++ DLL**. This project demonstrates accurate Newtonian multi-body dynamics using the Dormandâ€“Prince 5(4) integrator, live thrust maneuvers, and GPU-rendered trajectories.

**No built-in Unity physics used.**

> **Update:** Atmospheric drag has been fully integrated into the simulation. Initially, non-gravitational forces like drag and J2 perturbations were excluded intentionally to ensure the Dormandâ€“Prince 5(4) integrator's accuracy and stability. With foundational accuracy verified, atmospheric drag is now implemented to simulate realistic orbital decay and perturbations.

## What This Is

This is a simulation prototype that allows:

- Runtime placement of satellites with mass, radius, starting velocity and direction
- Thrust maneuvers: prograde, retrograde, radial, normal/anti-normal
- Atmospheric drag and realistic orbital decay
- Visualization of orbital trajectories with GPU acceleration
- Continuous tracking of apogee, perigee, velocity, and altitude
- Time scaling from 1x to 100x
- Two camera modes: Free and Track

The physics are offloaded to a native C++ library for improved performance, allowing Unity to focus on visualization and interaction.

## Why I Built This

After following real-world missions like SpaceX and exploring tools like GMAT, I wanted to build something hands-on that reflects actual orbital mechanics. This simulator became a platform to:

- Implementing advanced numerical integration (Dormandâ€“Prince 5(4))
- Model realistic perturbations like atmospheric drag.
- Explore multi-body gravitational systems in real time
- Work with C++ and Unity interoperability (DLL calls)
- Optimize both simulation logic and rendering

It also served as a way to deepen my understanding of orbital mechanics and real-time spaceflight simulation.

## System & Tools Breakdown

- **Physics Core (C++ DLL):** Dormandâ€“Prince 5(4) integrator for superior accuracy
- **Unity Frontend:** Object instantiation, camera controls, and trajectory visualization
- **Thrust Model:** Instantaneous velocity change (impulse burn) based on burn direction and current mass
- **Atmospheric Drag:** Real-time drag force calculations influencing orbital trajectories.
- **Trajectory Rendering:** GPU-drawn orbital paths for performance
- **Interop:** Unity uses `DllImport` to communicate with native physics functions
